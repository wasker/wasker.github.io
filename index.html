          <section class="content"><p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> was a real darling of 2015’s //build. It’s sleek, lightweight and promises great productivity&nbsp;gains.</p>
<p>There’s one problem though: it’s a bit hard to get started and requires some number of changes and adjustments to your development process. For starters, your workflows will shift to the command 
line usage along and NodeJS toolchain is expected to be used very often. Obviously, Visual Studio Code doesn’t come with all that in the box, and you are left exploring the ecosystem, unlike 
the original Visual Studio Code, when you could develop right&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>I spent a bit of time collecting the bare minimum of tools that will help you to get started and created a set of PowerShell scripts that will install all necessary bits on your devbox, including
Visual Studio Code itself. The script assumes that you don’t have any tools handy, self-contained and respects limited user account limitations, whenever&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://github.com/wasker/0-to-code">this repository</a> and follow the instructions to get&nbsp;started.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>So, I jumped the shark and bought Samsung <span class="caps">SH</span>-B123L drive. Drive comes with CyberLink PowerDVD9 freebie and that’s seems to be the only way to play Blu-ray discs on Windows 7, as there’s no built-in codec yet. The thing is that I fancy Windows Media Center and I really dislike flashy UI of CyberLink. Thankfully, CyberLink provides WMC plug-in which to some extent behaves like original DVD player in WMC, although not without annoyances. One of the major annoyances is that PowerDVD registers itself as regular DVD player as well and Media Center prompts you to choose between regular DVD player and CyberLink DVD player every time you want to play DVD in WMC. Another problem is that even though Blu-ray autoplay section is being created in Control Panel’s AutoPlay Center, there’s no way to select Windows Media Player to handle&nbsp;Blu-rays.</p>
<p>Here’s two steps that you need to do in order to make everybody play nicely&nbsp;together…</p>
