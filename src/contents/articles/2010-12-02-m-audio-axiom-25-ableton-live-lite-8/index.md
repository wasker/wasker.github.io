Got lovely Axiom 25 Gen 2 as a holiday gift? Don't be upset with DirectLink not working: the problem is with Live's support of DirectLink in version 8, it's broken - [Ableton's Live 8.2.2 beta fixes it](http://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=153512).

And you **have to** install M-Audio's drivers 1.1.2+ - the ones that come with Windows do not support DirectLink.
