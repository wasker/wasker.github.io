Visual Web Developer Express 2008's or Visual Studio 2008's HTML source/design view freezes after you upgraded to Office 2010 Beta from Office 2007 with symptoms: whenever you open source or design view for HTML page or do any step-by-step debugging within the view, the IDE eventually freezes beeping every time you click your mouse in the window.

Here's how to fix it...

<span class="more"></span>

1. Uninstall VWD Express, if present.
2. Uninstall Microsoft Visual Web Authoring Component, which is more likely has Office 2007 icon in Programs and Features view.
3. Install VWD Express back again or re-install SP1 for Visual Studio 2008.
